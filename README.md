# Backdoor
This backdoor can download and upload files, execute programs in the victim machine and has full persistance.    
| download and upload, may not work on C: or where it needs administrator privilege  
| exit -> to close the connection on both the sides.  

(download and upload may take some time as it uses json)  
upload file -> to upload to victim machine    
download file -> to download from victim machine    
start program.exe -> to start a program #Note: executing like this .\application.exe on windows will get the shell stuck and will only work back when the program is closed from the victim machine's side.
